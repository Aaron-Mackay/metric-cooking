metric-cooking
==============

Browser script that annotates US cooking units with their metric
equivalent, while also trying to convert from volumes to weights.
Examples, where the part in [] would be added by this script:

* I used about 1/4 to 1/3 of a cup [60–80 ml]
* 3/4 cup plus 2 tablespoons packed light-brown sugar [190 g]
* 1 1/2 sticks chilled unsalted butter [175 g]
* a tablespoon of heavy cream [15 g]
* 2/3 cup freshly grated Parmigiano-Reggiano [65 g]
* sides about 2 1/2 to 3 inches [6.5–7.5 cm] high
* ¾ cup plus 2 Tbs sugar [175 g]
* mandoline set to 1/16th of an inch [2 mm].
* a 5- to 6-quart [4.75–5.75 l] heavy pot
* between 12 ounces and a pound [350–450 g]
* at about 350-380 degrees (F) [175–195 °C]
* Butter a 13- by 9- by 2-inch [32.5×22.5×5 cm] baking pan

Installation
------------

* For Firefox, you need the [Greasemonkey

The script produces often adds bogus annotations and can slow down the
browser, so it is recommended to turn it on only if you need it.
